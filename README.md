# Smart Home System with Raspberry Pi and ESP Modules

## Overview

This smart home system integrates various functionalities such as camera streaming, temperature monitoring, and stepper motor control using a Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, and ESP32-CAM modules. It features a web-based interface with several tabs to control and monitor different aspects of the system. The repository includes programs for all ESP modules used in this project.

### Setup

#### Python Libraries Installation
To set up your environment, you need to install the following Python libraries:
```python 
pip install Flask
pip install flask_socketio
pip install flask_sqlalchemy
pip install requests
pip install flask_httpauth
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install Pillow
```
#### Hardware and Software Setup
##### 1. Raspberry Pi Setup:
	- Attach the Raspberry Pi Camera Module.
	- Follow the instructions for software setup and dependencies.
##### 2. ESP Modules Setup:
	- Connect the LED and DHT11 Sensor to the ESP8266. Connect the stepper motor to the appropriate pins.
	- Flash the ESP32-CAM with the required firmware.

##### 3. Network Configuration:
	- Ensure all devices are connected to the same local network.

##### Running the System
To start the system, navigate to the git folder and execute the following commands in three separate terminals:

```bash 
python espCapture.py
python stream.py
python app.py
```

### Usage
